    "We use the SOAP power spectrum vectors as atomic descriptors for the structures [(Bartók, 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.87.184115).\n",
    "Understanding SOAP vectors is not necessary for this tutorial, although they are crucial for correlating chemical environments and materials properties. For now, consider the power spectrum SOAP vectors as a three-body correlation function which includes information on each atom, its relationships with neighboring atoms, and the relationships between pairs of neighbors. The correlation function is expanded on a dense basis, and the feature vector contains more information than it is necessary for these tutorials, so we use [farthest point sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farthest-first_traversal) to only include 200 components of the SOAP vectors while still retaining much of their diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP vectors are computed with the librascal package [(librascal GitHub)](https://github.com/cosmo-epfl/librascal). If you don't want (or cannot) install librascal, you can download a precomputed version datafile `precomputed.npz`, that you should store in the `datasets/` folder, as discussed in the [foreword](0_Foreword.ipynb) to this tutorial.  You should then be able to run all tutorials without having to install librascal. "
